# context-processing
context-proccessing text processing tokenizer, normalizer, stope word removal , stemmer, lemmatize. 
the program would take these three files:
amazon_cells_labelled.txt
imdb_labelled.txt
yelp_labelled.txt
and would retrive 3 .csv file as an output 
in each output there is strig contains 0 and 1 for each word in the vocabulary wordlist  wich means that this word exist int ith sentence or not.
I also upload the .rar project file but just remember to add libraries!
these are libraries that i used :
edu.standford.nlp library
opennlp library
