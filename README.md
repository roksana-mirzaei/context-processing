# context-processing
context-proccessing text processing tokenizer, normalizer, stope word removal , stemmer, lemmatize. 


the program would take these three files:

amazon_cells_labelled.txt

imdb_labelled.txt

yelp_labelled.txt


and would retrive 3 .csv file as an output 

in each output there is strig contains 0 and 1 for each word in the vocabulary wordlist  wich means that this word exist int ith sentence or not.

I also upload the .rar project file but just remember to add libraries!
